The stock, which had hit a record closing high of $739 last Wednesday, fell 4.4% on Tuesday, its biggest single-day drop since October.\nInvestors have come to expect only the best from Nvidia, so anything less than a blowout earnings report with strong guidance when the company reports after today's market close could be perceived negatively by market participants. The trading action in recent days indicates that some investors believe that the optimism surrounding Nvidia, which Goldman Sachs has dubbed the \"most important stock on planet earth,\" may have gotten exaggerated.\nBill Baruch, founder and president of Blue Line Capital, said onCNBCWednesday that his firm had sold 20% of its Nvidia stake on Tuesday. \"We've reduced this and really just monetizing the move that's happened. One of my fears more than anything is just an unwind,\" he said, citing \"tremendouscallspeculation.\"\nBaruch said he could build his position back up if the stock drops to around $610 or $620, as Nvidia is the clear leader in the early innings of AI. \"I would love to reestablish a stronger position at that level,\" he said.\nWhile the stock price has tumbled,analysts have been raising their estimatesfor Nvidia. According to analysts' estimates compiled by Visible Alpha, revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter is now seen at $20.80 billion, compared with $6.05 billion a year earlier, while net income is projected at $10.58 billion, up from $1.41 billion. A week ago, the consensus view called for revenue of $20.38 billion and net income of $10.40 billion.\nAnalysts at Wedbush said that their conversations with server manufacturers show \"lifting backlog on better sales momentum\" for Nvidia. \"The only question around NVDA's near-term performance and outlook, in our view, is to what magnitude results and guidance will exceed\" estimates, according to a report last week.\nFollowing its last two earnings release, inAugustandNovember, even with tremendous beats on profit and revenue, the stock fell in the immediate aftermath of the report only to eventually turn higher.\n\"The company has delivered strong earnings before only to disappoint a voracious market that expects ever more\xa0as it trades at a hefty valuation,\" LPL Financial's chief global strategist, Quincy Krosby, said Wednesday in a market commentary.\nWith amarket capitalizationof nearly $1.7 trillion, Nvidia is the fourth most-valuable company in the S&P 500 after Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), meaning results could have an outsized impact on the index after the report.\n\"After today's market close, global traders and investors alike will focus on earnings, but the guidance offered will be crucial not just for NVDA but for the broader market, a market that is in need of a viable positive catalyst,\" Krosby added.\nBloomberg. \"Goldman’s Trading Desk Calls Nvidia ‘Most Important Stock’ on Earth.\"\nNvidia. \"Financial reports.\"\n",

		"content": "Suspect in death of Audrii Cunningham charged with capital murder after the girl’s body was found in a river tied to a rock\nFollow:\nDon Steven McDougal, the family friend accused of killing 11-year-old Audrii Cunningham in Livingston, Texas, is now charged with capital murder, according to court documents filed in Polk County on Wednesday.\nMcDougal – who was already in jail in connection with an unrelated assault case – was ordered to be held without bond.\n“Video footage and cell phone data places McDougal at three locations of interest,” including along the Trinity River, where Audrii’s body was recovered Tuesday, according to a criminal complaint.\nInvestigators say McDougal had agreed to take the girl to a school bus stop on the morning that she disappeared, but she never arrived. In the complaint, a sheriff’s deputy said there is evidence “McDougal lied about his whereabouts and activities on the day of February 15, 2024.”\nA large rock was found tied around Audrii’s body when her remains were discovered, the court document says. “The rope used was consistent with rope that was observed in McDougal’s vehicle on a traffic stop two days prior,” the complaint states.\nNeither the court documents filed Wednesday nor jail records list an attorney for McDougal.\nAudrii’s family thought McDougal was just taking the girl down the street to the bus stop when the pair left her home Thursday morning, Polk County officials said. But she never made it onto the school bus or into her classroom, and a bag resembling her bright red, Hello Kitty backpack was later found near a local dam.\nAudrii’s body was found Tuesday in the Trinity River, downstream from the reservoir near where the backpack was found. It was one of several locations McDougal told investigators he had gone around the time of her disappearance, Sheriff Byron Lyons said.\nInvestigators located Audrii’s remains using cell phone records, video analysis and information from McDougal, Lyons said.\nThe condition of Audrii’s remains is not being released, the sheriff said, and the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office will determine her cause of death.\nTo help uncover the body, Lyons said, water management authorities slowed the flow of water from the Lake Livingston reservoir – one of thelargest reservoirs in the state, with 83,000 surface acres – allowing the river level to recede enough to reveal the remains.\nRelated articleWhat we know about Audrii Cunningham, the Texas girl who vanished on her way to school, and the man suspected in her death\n“I express my deepest sympathies and condolences to everyone who knew, who cared for and loved Audrii,” the sheriff said. “We will continue to process the evidence that has been gathered to ensure justice for Audrii.”\nMcDougal, a friend of Audrii’s father, lived in a trailer on the family’s property and sometimes took the girl to catch her school bus in the neighborhood, the sheriff said. He has been the main person of interest in her disappearance as authorities frantically scoured the rural east Texas town of Livingston – about 70 miles northeast of Houston, he said.\nMcDougal joined the search efforts and was seen knocking on neighborhood doors and asking if anyone had seen Audrii, the sheriff told CNN. But Lyons didn’t believe his efforts were genuine.\n“To me, it simply tells me is that he’s trying to give the appearances that he has no play or he’s not at fault in her disappearance and that (he’s) part of the concerned parties who were trying to locate her,” Lyons said Tuesday.\nIn the days after Audrii vanished, McDougal claimed in several social media comments that he was not guilty of her disappearance and had “done nothing wrong,” according to activity on a Facebook account appearing to belong to the suspect.\n“I’m not guilty,” reads a comment from the account under a post on the Facebook page “True Crime Society” the day after Audrii was reported missing.\n“I was there and was questioned. I am not running or hiding,” McDougal wrote before commenting again and saying, “I have done everything I can to help find her. I have done nothing wrong.”\nCNN has sought comment from investigators about the Facebook comments.\nMcDougal has a lengthy criminal history dating back to at least 2003, with convictions for violent crimes and one for enticing a child, according to court records in several Texas counties.\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice listed McDougal’s sentences:\nIn 2007, he was convicted of enticing a child in Brazoria County, Texas. Court records show he pleaded no contest and was sentenced to two years in prison but was given credit for 527 days.\nOnline records do not detail the specific allegations in the child enticement case. But the offense is defined by the state as “the intent tointerfere with the lawful custody of a childyounger than 18 years” when a person “entices, persuades, or takes the child from the custody of the parent or guardian.”\nMcDougal was also convicted in 2010 and 2019 for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.\nThe victim in the first aggravated assault case said McDougal, his former coworker, attacked him after being thrown out of his house.\n“He showed up with some other friends that I had,” Elic\xa0Bryan told CNN on Tuesday.\nMcDougal started stabbing the door before coming back inside, Bryan said.\n“He came at me with the knife, and I had my shotgun, and I hit him in the face with it,” Bryan said. “I had no idea he was that kind of person.”\nThat aggravated assault case led to a four-year prison sentence.\nAudrii’s loved ones are now grappling with not just the agony of her death, but also the criminal investigation of a suspect once considered a family friend.\nThe fifth-grader’s classmates and teachers are also grieving, the Livingston Independent School District said ina statementon Facebook.\n“While the details of this tragedy are still unfolding, our hearts go out to the entire community during this heartbreaking loss,” superintendent Brent Hawkins said.\nDuring the dayslong search for Audrii, her mother said she understood the anguish of parents of missing children, whom she had only heard about on the news.\n“There’s not words for it. There is not one feeling you feel. It’s a roller coaster. You are broken, you are mad, you are empty. And right now, I am empty,” Matthews toldCNN affiliate KPRCon Friday.\n“She has so many opportunities ahead of her, and she deserves every right to be able to reach those opportunities.”\nCNN’s Caroll Alvarado, Andy Rose, Amy Simonson, Amanda Jackson and Jillian Sykes contributed to this report.\n© 2024 Cable News Network.
